<h1>Optimizing for size</h1>
</header>
I was wondering how small it was possible to make could get a non trivial program, without actually changing the code itself, ie: mostly compiler flags and such.<br/>
I might be using "non trivial" wrongly here but I mean a program that can actually do something.<br/>
<br/>
Well, let us start with a non trivial program and go from there,<br/>
For this I will make use of the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/erkkah/tigr">tigr graphics library</a><br/>
<br/>
<pre>
<code class="language-c">#include <stdlib.h>
#include "tigr.h"
#include <time.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int randomNo(int min, int max) {
  return min + rand() / (RAND_MAX / (max - min + 1) + 1);
}

int main() {

  srand(time(NULL));

  Tigr *screen = tigrWindow(320, 240, "Hello", 0);
  int x, y;
  char *fmt = malloc(100);
  while (!tigrClosed(screen)) {
    tigrClear(screen, tigrRGB(0x11, 0x11, 0x11));

    tigrPrint(screen, tfont, 120, 110, tigrRGB(0xf0, 0xf0, 0xf0),
              "Hello, world.");
	snprintf(fmt, 100, "%d, %d", x, y);
	tigrPrint(screen, tfont, 120, 110 + 16, tigrRGB(0xf0, 0xf0, 0xf0), fmt);

    tigrMouse(screen, &x, &y, NULL);
    tigrFillCircle(screen, x, y, 8, tigrRGB(0xff, 0x00, 0x00));

    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      int x = randomNo(0, 320);
      int y = randomNo(0, 240);
      tigrLine(screen, x, y, x, y + 10, tigrRGB(0x00, 0x00, 0xff));
    }

    tigrUpdate(screen);
  }
  free(fmt);
  tigrFree(screen);
  return 0;
}	</code>

Nothing flashy, it just opens a window, draws some text and some rain.<br/>
Compiling with <code>cc app.c tigr.c -o app -lGl -lX11</code> gives us our executable, whose size is 76kb.<br/>
<br/>
For such a simple program, surely we can do better right?<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="compiler-flags">Compiler Flags</h2>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<h3 id="-os">-Os</h3>
<p>
How about telling the compiler to optimize for size with the <code>-Os</code> flag?<br/>
With it, The new binary is 68kb, a decrease of 10.52%, Not bad if I say so myself.<br/>
However in my experience this doesnt always happen, quite often the decrease is so small, that it won't even be measured.<br/>
<br/>
You can find out what it does by starting from here, <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options</a><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h3 id="-s">-s</h3>
<p>
Despite adding <code>-Os</code>, the compiler still adds in a bunch of debug information that we don't really need, so if we ask we can <code>strip</code> it from the binary.<br/>
<br/>
Adding it via the compiler flag <code>-s</code>, We get a binary 26% smaller than the 76kb original, not bad.<br/>
(Instead of the compiler flag, you can use <code>-s</code> on a compiled binary.)<br/>
<br/>
You can sort of see this with the <code>strings</code> utility, initially our binary contained 1363 strings, after stripping it contained 339.<br/>
<br/>
Following the saying, "Good artists create, Great artists steal", Consulting <a href="https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust">https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust</a> , We find one thing of interest, Link Time Optimization (LTO)..<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h3 id="-flto">-flto</h3>
<p>
Basically this tells the linker to apply optimizations during linking time. It's more complicated than that but I don't understand it.<br/>
<br/>
So what does it do for us?<br/>
Quite a bit, Using it we have shaved off 16kb to reach 40kb, so in total (with -Os and -s) a 47% decrease of our initial 76kb, not bad at all.<br/>
<br/>
<b>NOTE</b>: Enabling <code>-flto</code> sometimes caused me a segfault at program start with clang, but this didnt occur with GCC, so it seems like GCC has a more mature implementation.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h2 id="executable-packing">Executable Packing</h2>
<p>
If you wanted to go even furthur you could try <a href="https://upx.github.io/">UPX</a>, Which actually compresses your biniary and this works since<br/>
the decompression code + compressed data ends up smaller than the initial binary.<br/>
<br/>
Although some would consider this cheating, It is still a legtimate method and does work,<br/>
Running it with the highest compression level (-9) on our 40kb binary yields a binary size of 24kb, A decrease of 60% which is undeniably really impressive.<br/>
<br/>
<b>NOTE:</b> Since upx is often used in malware, There are chances it might get flagged by an antivirus,<br/>
But running through virus total shows only <a href="https://is.gd/MtqIMG">results</a> from Google & Ikarus(?)<br/>
<br/>
<b>NOTE:</b> In a web enviroment, files are usually transferred while being gzip-compressed, UPX would be negligible for .wasm files and it doesnt support it anyway.<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
So in total we managed to decrease our binary by <b>68%</b> without changing a single line of code, Less than half of its original size<br/>
I am very pleased with that..<br/>
<br/>
Of course, even this isn't anything compared to marvellous feats of engineering like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.kkrieger">.kkreiger</a>, A entire 3d fps game demo in a extremely impressive 95kb,<br/>
When code is <i>actually written</i> to be small, and optimized to the limit towards that purpose.<br/>
